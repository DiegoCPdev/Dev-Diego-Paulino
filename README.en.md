## About Me

I currently work as a construction manager in civil engineering, but I've always been passionate about technology. Influenced by family, I initially followed a career in construction, but at the age of 21, I decided to pursue my true interest: software development.

I'm transitioning careers and aiming to become a back-end developer. Next semester, I’ll begin a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at FIAP.
