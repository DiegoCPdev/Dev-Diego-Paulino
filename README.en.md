## About me

I currently work as a construction site supervisor in civil engineering. Although I followed a family-driven path in this field, I’ve always had a strong interest in technology.

At 21, I decided to pursue my real passion: software development. I’m now transitioning to tech and will begin my degree in Systems Analysis and Development at FIAP next semester.
